# Evil-Twin

The way that Evil TWIN works is that the attacker sets up a fake wifi network that is similar to the network we know in order to make the user connect to it instead of a reliable network.</br>
After the user connects to our fake network, </br>
we will listen to the traffic on his network and thus it is possible to extract password information and personal details...</br>
